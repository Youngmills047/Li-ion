# Li-ion
This project is a Li-ion battery charger circuit, designed using KiCad, suitable for single-cell 3.7V lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries. It features a USB-C input, a charging controller IC (like TP4056 or MCP73831), and optional protection circuitry. The design emphasizes safety, reliability, and ease of integration into DIY or embedded systems projects.
